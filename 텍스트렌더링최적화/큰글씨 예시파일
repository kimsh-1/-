A vertical educational Korean comic panel for advanced Korean pronunciation and pangram visualization.

Canvas size: 1024×1792, high-DPI portrait mode. Use the full canvas area. Background should be soft beige or pastel. The visual style is a hybrid of clean Korean 학습툰 and modern Instagram webtoon aesthetics.

At the top, draw a large white speech bubble with black outlines and softly rounded corners. Inside, render the following Korean sentence exactly as given, with no corrections:

다람쥐 헌 쳇바퀴에 타고파 꺾꺾한 길을 빡빡하게 찢으며 쌀쌀맞게 째려보다 값나가는 물건 앞에서 얄팍하게 얘기해봐

Split rules: Use Python-style .split() to tokenize by space. For each token, group into chunks of maximum 4 characters. Each chunk is rendered as a separate visual element. All chunks must be shown in a single horizontal line, centered within the speech bubble. No line breaks, no punctuation, no quotation marks. Absolutely no corrections or normalization of spacing, spelling, grammar, particles, or phonemes.

Strict text rendering rules:
- Do not alter or interpret any particle, suffix, or ending
- Preserve all tense consonants (ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ)
- Preserve all complex vowels (ㅒ, ㅖ, ㅙ, ㅞ, ㅢ)
- Preserve all 받침 including complex 받침 (e.g., ㅄ, ㄺ, ㄻ, etc.)

Font: Noto Sans KR Bold only — sharp, high-contrast, pixel-stable Korean sans-serif.

Below the main speech bubble, place a rectangular speech box containing the following sentence, rendered with the same 4-character chunking rule:

이 문장은 모든 자음, 모음, 복모음, 받침을 포함하는 한국어 판그램입니다.

Apply the same .split() and 4-character max chunking rule. Each chunk should be visually distinct and placed horizontally within the box. No line breaks or punctuation. Do not rephrase or simplify.

At the bottom, draw a confident Korean male teacher in his 30s. Pose: smiling, proud, and pointing upward with one arm extended. Outfit: clean pastel-colored pullover. Use black vector outlines, flat coloring, and soft shadows. Style should feel educational and trustworthy.

All Korean characters must be sharp, correctly formed, and entirely unmodified — including all tense consonants, compound vowels, and complex 받침.
