VEO2
A top-down cinematic shot of multiple glowing arcane circles made of neon-blue and golden glyphs, rotating and shifting in complex orbits over a futuristic metallic ritual platform; suddenly, crackling plasma-like electricity surges inward, violently concentrating at the center; a burst of radiant energy explodes upward as the magic activates — ultra-detailed, photorealistic, sci-fi fantasy fusion, dark ambient lighting, volumetric glow, dramatic energy flow, 5 seconds

SORA
A vast aerial view of giant glowing arcane circles floating in the sky, composed of luminous runes and holographic symbols, rotating slowly above the clouds; as the wind swirls, streams of electric energy surge from the rings into the center, culminating in a massive vertical energy beam shooting into the heavens — sci-fi fantasy hybrid, cinematic lighting, volumetric clouds, ethereal atmosphere, ultra-detailed, photorealistic, 5 seconds
