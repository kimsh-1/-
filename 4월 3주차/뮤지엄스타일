A grand museum gallery with polished marble floors and classical architecture. In the center stands a glossy Calacatta marble bust of a tabby cat with large round glasses, a hoodie, and an ID badge sculpted into the chest. The cat holds a tablet as part of the marble sculpture, the screen's engravings meticulously carved into the stone. The marble texture captures the feline's soft fur pattern with fine veining and lifelike detail. Warm, focused lighting casts dramatic shadows, accentuating the catâ€™s wise and contemplative expression. Several visitors surround the sculpture, admiring the serene and intellectual presence of the feline figure. Some lean in to appreciate the finely chiseled glasses and hoodie folds, while others take photos of this uniquely modern yet classical tribute. The atmosphere is reverent and softly illuminated, enhancing the quiet sophistication of the setting.
