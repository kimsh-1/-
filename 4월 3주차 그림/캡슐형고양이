A highly detailed transparent gashapon capsule is gently held between thumb and index finger. Inside is a miniature version of the gray tabby cat in the reference image, realistically textured with soft striped fur. The cat wears the same round glasses and teal hoodie, faithfully recreated with plush figure aesthetics.

The capsule interior is a cozy futuristic tech pod. The cat is seated in front of a compact cyber workstation featuring softly glowing cyan-white holographic displays and a small mechanical keyboard with animated RGB light. The inner wall of the capsule is etched with circuit-like patterns that pulse faintly with light.

The capsule is partially open, revealing a blurred futuristic cityscape in the distance through a translucent shell. Lighting is cybernetic and high-contrast: soft ambient blue mixed with glowing silver tones. The cat’s expression appears focused but slightly curious.

The overall mood is serene and creative — like a sci-fi maker pod rather than a sterile lab. Soft cinematic highlights and macro studio photography aesthetic, portrait orientation, high resolution.
